# Using GitHub

## Core Functionality

GitHub is no longer **JUST** hosted code Git repositories &amp; version control - though that is still what it is primarily used for.

Microsoft is slowly adding more features that fall under **Integrated DevOps Environment**:

* Source &amp; Version Control
* Workitem Management (using Issues and Projects)
* Documentation (using README.md, Wiki, Discussions, and/or GitHub Pages)
  * this document uses GitHub Pages + Jekyll + Just the Docs (theme)
* CI/CD (using Actions)
* Environments
* Project Metrics (using Insights)
  * Dependencies (shown in Metrics)
* 3rd Party Integrations

## Source &amp; Version Control

Source &amp; Version Control is an absolute necessity for good software process management and the primary use of GitHub.
